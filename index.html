    <h1>MyFitnessRank | Global Running Performance Analysis</h1>

    <p>MyFitnessRank is a web application designed to help runners understand their running performance on a global scale. By comparing your running times with real race data from worldwide marathon events, MyFitnessRank provides detailed analytics on where you stand among runners globally. Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or elite athlete, knowing how your time ranks can be a powerful motivator and training guide.</p>

    <h2>Core Features of MyFitnessRank</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Record Input:</strong> Users can input their running time, gender, age, and distance (5K, 10K, Half Marathon, or Full Marathon).</li>
      <li><strong>Global Ranking Analysis:</strong> Based on major race data, we calculate your percentile ranking. For example, "You are faster than 65% of global 10K runners."</li>
      <li><strong>Histogram Visualizations:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Overall runner distribution histogram</li>
          <li>Gender-specific distribution</li>
          <li>Gender and age group-specific distribution</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Simulated Race Position:</strong> We simulate your rank in famous real-world races. For example, "In the 2024 New York Marathon, your time would place you at the 55th percentile."</li>
      <li><strong>Goal Setting Simulation:</strong> Wondering what happens if you improve your time? MyFitnessRank shows projections like, "If you cut 10 minutes, you'll reach the top 40% of runners."</li>
      <li><strong>Predicting Times for Other Distances:</strong> For example, "Based on your 10K time, your predicted Half Marathon time is 1 hour 50 minutes."</li>
      <li><strong>Age-Graded Results:</strong> We adjust your time for age to show equivalent performances. For example, "Your 10K time is similar to a 48-minute run for a runner in their 20s."</li>
    </ul>
